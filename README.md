# Sorting Visualization Project

This project provides an interactive web-based tool to visualize various sorting algorithms. Users can input an array of numbers and see how different sorting algorithms work in real-time through animations.

## Features

- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms:** Visualize algorithms such as:

  - Bubble Sort
  - Bucket Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Radix Sort

- **Interactive Input:** Users can enter any array of integers and select the desired sorting algorithm from a dropdown menu.

- **Real-time Visualization:** The sorting process is displayed through dynamically generated bars, showcasing comparisons and swaps in an engaging way.
